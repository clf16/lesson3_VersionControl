            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the most important concepts to understand in this lesson is version control. This is a particular system that keeps track of files when they change and stores them so that the developer can access them later. It is important for web designers, web developers, and graphic designers because it allows the developer to go back to the original state of the project, compare the old to the new, and who has fixed the file just in case something goes wrong. It allows information to be easily recoverable which is a good tool to have when creating. It is interesting to know because since I want to be able to develop webpages, I want tools like this to be easily reached when dealing with a lot of code. This is important to the course because since we are constantly changing code, it is good to know all the tools we have to make developing easier and for things to go smoothly.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git’s Beginning</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The major concept of this lesson is using Git in our systems while developing webpages. So before Git, there was this open source software called The Linux kernel that stored changes by passing them around in archived files. They later then incorporated BitKeeper. However, this called a lot of problems that made developers want to create a system that was faster, easy to use, could store a lot of space, and much more. Thus, Git was created and it allowed a big branch system to easily support linear development. So I found this interesting because I really didn’t know what Git was or what its purpose is. So after realizing the importance, I can see how important it is in our course, because it allows our developments to flow easier and help support our projects.

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">

                <span class="text-muted">Git as the Snapchat of Technology</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has a particular way of storing data that is much different than other VCS. Git takes series of snapshots of small files of that particular state of the project when you commit. It then stores that “picture” in its system. So the next time you commit, the last snapshot will be linked to the new one, so that data turns into a stream to see the progress of that particular project. Other VCS stores these files as a list and it isn’t as proficient as Git, since Git makes it a great tool to use. I think it is interesting how a program like Git can store lots of information like this which makes developers like us be able to understand what goes on when working on a project. Knowing this in our course will make troubleshooting a lot easier in the long run.

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">The Three States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So Git has three states that files are saved in which are committed, modified, and staged. When the state is committed, this means that the data being saved is being saved safely in your local database. When the state is modified, that means the file has been changed by the user, however, this file was not committed to the database yet. So the committed state and modified state goes hand in hand when it comes to storing data. The final state is staged which means a marked modified file is the newer version of the snapshot and will be connected to the stream. They all go hand in hand to make a good Git software. I find it interesting to know how they all correlate with each other and how it depends on one another. It is essential to know in our course for future professions and projects, due to troubleshoot and developing. </p>

        <!-- Fifth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #5
                <span class="text-muted">Git and Data</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Just like other VCS systems, Git stores and adds data. But the difference between Git and other VCS is that within an action, Git adds data to the Git database. With other VCS, data is pretty much permanently stored which is undoable. So if you lose something or change something that you don’t want commit, it is easy to lose that data. Git makes it easy to go back and fix data and not lose data especially if the developer is consistently pushing the database into different repositories. This is interesting to know how Git differs from different VCS, so it is viable in this course to know which is better to use as developer tools, especially as we are learning to store datas in different repositories. </p>
